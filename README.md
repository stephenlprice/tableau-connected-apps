# Tableau Connected Apps

A collection of [Tableau Connected Apps](https://www.tableau.com/about/blog/2022/1/how-seamlessly-integrate-analytics-your-product-connected-apps) code samples. Connected Apps is the latest [JWT](https://jwt.io/) authentication and SSO method available on the Tableau platform. Authentication via this method is supported for both Tableau's [REST API](https://help.tableau.com/current/api/rest_api/en-us/REST/rest_api.htm) and for displaying visualization using the [Embedding API v3](https://help.tableau.com/current/api/embedding_api/en-us/index.html). To understand how these APIs and Connected Apps work together to extend the Tableau platform and add analytical capabilities to your application, refer to the [Embedded Analytics Playbook](https://tableau.github.io/embedding-playbook/).
